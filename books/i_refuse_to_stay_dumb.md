### Latin American History
#### Pre-Columbian
##### General
Ancient Mexico and Central America: Archaeology and Culture History (2008) by Susan Toby Evans: An encyclopedia-like work covering virtually every Mesoamerican culture. This is the standard textbook for all university classes on the subject, but it serves most effectively as a reference book. The comprehensive bibliography will provide you with an index for the entire field of Mesoamerican studies.

### Mesoamerican Archaeology: Theory and Practice (2007) edited by Julia Hendon and Rosemary Joyce. 
A collection of academic papers about various Mesoamerican cultures. An extremely valuable, if somewhat eclectic resource. Recommended for readers who already have some background in archaeology and are looking for a more advanced introductory work.

### Mexico: From the Olmecs to the Aztecs (6th ed. 2008) by Michael Coe and Rex Koontz
This slim, introductory text to the archaeological history of Central Mexico covers a wide range of Mesoamerican cultures both historic and contemporary. Michael Coe, one of the foremost figures in the field, does an excellent job of helping readers gain a sense of the commonalities that united the various societies of Mesoamerica as well as grasp some of the big questions facing archaeologists today. Some reflections on Mexico's pre-Columbian past are offered by Coe and he also provides a solid further reading section near the end of the text. Maya enthusiasts should note that this work does not deal with the Maya, who are covered in Coe's larger and equally respectable work The Maya.

### America's First Cuisines (1994) by Sophie D. Coe
Coe provides a summary of foods available to the Aztec, Maya, and Inca peoples based off of a mixture of archaeological and historical evidence. Coe talks about how certain foods were domesticated, prepared, and consumed. While this list of foods is not complete in any way, it does provide a general overview of foods consumed on a daily basis. While this work could use an update with recent archaeological work and theory on plant domestication, it is still a highly recommended piece of literature for anyone wanting to investigate food.

### The Book of the Year: Middle American Calendrical Systems (1988) by Munros Edmonson
Edmonson attempts in this work to explain the various calendric systems encountered over time and space in Mesoamerica starting with the Olmec and working his way towards Contact. While this work can often be at times confusing and needing multiple rereads of passages, his work does make a lot of sense and offers insightful explanations as to how calenders spread and the changes it underwent from each passing. This is an advanced work for those interested in Mesoamerican calendrics and requires a working knowledge of multiple calender systems to understand this work fully.

### Olmec
Olmec Archaeology and Early Mesoamerica (2007) by Christopher Pool: As one of the oldest high societies of Mesoamerica, the Olmecs remain a frustrating enigma to Mesoamericanists studying the formative stages of the Mesoamerican cultural sphere. Pool's piece offers readers a relatively contemporary look into the current efforts to unravel the social structures and cultural extent of the Olmecs. Of particular interest is his treatment of the relationship between the Olmec Heartland and surrounding cultures, which provides a thorough evaluation of the early connections between the Olmecs and other Mexican peoples. Olmec Archaeology is somewhat thicker than other texts recommended here and readers will find it a more challenging affair but the sheer depth of the text will make the extra work worthwhile for the committed reader.

### Maya
#### Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization (2004) by Arthur Demarest
There are many wonderful texts on the Maya but Demarest's work is distinctive in the degree to which it overtly discusses the competing perspectives on the development of Maya society as well as directly grapples with the shortcomings of our knowledge of the ancient Maya. Such an approach is invaluable in the field of Mayan studies, which has undergone many paradigm shifts over the years. Demarest's position is well-balanced and thoughtful and his prose is accessible, making this text a good foundation on which readers can build a greater understanding of the Maya with further reading.

### A Forest of Kings: The Untold Story of the Ancient Maya (1992) by David Freidel and Linda Schele
This was a landmark book when it was published detailing the history of the Maya world based off the newly translated hieroglyphs. Linda Schele was the epigrapher of the Maya world up until her death and her work, including this one, made landmark strides in the field. This is a must read for those just getting into the Maya region and wanting to know the specifics of their history during the Classic period.

### Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman's Path (1993) by David Freidel, Linda Schele, and Joy Parker
After the publication of A Forest of Kings and with the help of Joy Parker, the three authors explore Maya cosmology and religion using the newly translated inscriptions of temples, stela, and vessels from across the Maya world. While recent work has updated what we know of the region this is still a solid piece of work that lays out a foundation of understanding for anyone interested in the Maya.

### The Code of Kings: The Language of Seven Sacred Maya Temples and Tombs (1999) by Linda Schele and Peter Mathews
Schele and Mathews explore seven sites from across the Maya world in depth to get an understanding of the diversity and variety of settlements archaeology and epigraphers have uncovered. With such detailed descriptions of buildings, artwork, and history of these seven settlements it will leave you yearning to go out and research other cities in an attempt to match their level of detail.

### The Memory of Bones: Body, Being, and Experience Among the Classic Maya (2006) by Stephen Houston, David Stuart, and Karl Taube
Three of the greatest epigraphers from the Maya region collaborated on this book to give us an understanding of how the Classic Maya viewed the world around them. Pulling from inscriptions on temples, stela, and vessels the authors paint a picture of how the Maya viewed their body, viewed life and death, and viewed nature. This is a linguistics heavy work and it may deter some who find it daunting, but it is one of the most insightful books you can read to truly understand these people who left such large cities behind.

### The Classic Maya (2008) by Stephen Houston and Takeshi Inomata
Houston and Inomata's work offers an update from Schele's 1999 work with new translations of inscriptions coupled with archaeological finds over the decade. Houston has become one of the top epigraphers of the Maya region and Inomata is a top-notch archaeologist and both have contributed greatly to the field and our understanding of the Maya past.

### Chronicle of the Maya Kings and Queens (2008) by Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube
This work offers an up to date history of the Classic Period Maya based off of inscriptions and archaeological work since the publication of Schele and Freidel's A Forest of Kings. This book is noted for its detail in understanding the relationships between different polities such as Tikal and Teotihuacan or Calakmul's alliance used to defeat Tikal.

### Aztec
The Aztecs (1996) by Michael E. Smith. Comprehensive overview of Aztec (though primarily Mexica) history.
This book is designed for a lay audience and summarizes both modern scholarship and primary sources. A great launching point for further reading. A bit heavier on the social aspects of life than the Townsend book.

### The Aztecs (3rd ed. 2009) by Richard F. Townsend.
Another comprehensive overview of Aztec history, though again with a Mexican bias. Focuses more on the "imperial project" than the Smith book.

### Aztec Warfare: Imperial Expansion and Political Control by Ross Hassig (1988). The authoritative book on warfare and the expansion of the Aztecs in Post-Classic Mexico. Skims over the pre-Imperial period and may be a bit more dense than some might enjoy. Still, its an essential text to for anyone looking to be an Aztec military buff.

### Daily Life of the Aztecs: People of the Sun and Earth (2nd ed. 2011) by David Carrasco and Scott Sessions.
Delves not only into the "daily life" but also the symbolism and philosophy behind many rituals both domestic and political. Features extensive quotations from primary sources, but is very reader friendly.

### Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind (1963) by Miguel Leon-Portilla: 
Leon-Portilla's Aztec Thought was of pivotal significance to the field of Aztec studies and is a truly remarkable interpretation of the philosophy and worldviews of Post-Classical Nahua peoples. Leon-Portilla's reevaluation of source materials and codices radically challenge many of the preconceived notions of Aztec society that laymen and academics alike, bringing to light the great importance of art and poetry to the Aztecs. Laymen schooled in Philosophy will have the easiest time work through Leon-Portilla's interpretation, but all will walk away with a deeper appreciation of Aztec culture.

### Handbook to Life in the Aztec World (2007) by Manuel Aguilar-Moreno: 
A good companion to Carrasco's Daily Life of the Aztecs, Moreno's work functions as an excellent reference for readers who are just beginning to learn about the Aztecs and their history. Aguilar-Moreno breaks Aztec society into neat, easily digested components each with their own designated section that can either be read individually or as a whole with little fuss. Aquilar-Moreno keeps his language accessible and distills archaeological work down to what is most essential to placing a particular site, artifact, or model into its larger historical context which helps keep readers engaged.

### Zapotec & Mixtec
The Cloud People: Divergent Evolution of the Zapotec and Mixtec Civilizations (1983) by Kent Flannery and Joyce Marcus: This work is somewhat of a staple within Oaxaca studies and constituted the first comprehensive synthesis of Mixtec-Zapotec history. Flannery and Marcus not only bring the Zapotec and the Mixtec together but also place the region - often treated as isolated from the rest of Mesoamerica - into a larger context that helps explain the fission of both cultures as well as the peculiarities that separated them from the rest of Mesoamerica. Some of his conclusions are controversial. Specifically, scholars such as A. Joyce (2009) claim that he places too much emphasis on military and ecological factors in his explanations of state formation. The issue is currently a subject of controversy in the academic literature. Nevertheless, his work is well written and easily digestible to a lay audience, as long as one takes his causal explanations 'with a grain of salt.'

### In the Realm of Eight Deer: The Archaeology of the Mixtec Codices (1994) by Bruce E. Byland and John M. D. Pohl
This book provides a fantastic synthesis of historic, ethnographic, and archaeological data. An archaeological survey recorded occupations and mapped them in relation to indigenous place names. They compared this with the glyphic names presented in the Mixtec codices, and were able to prove that the codices reflected the actual geography of the Mixteca region. They then attempt to reconstruct the history of the Mixtec people based on the surviving paper codices. The work is phenomenal, and a must read for anybody interested in the Mixtecs.

### Tarascan
Tariacuri's Legacy: The Prehispanic Tarascan State (1993) by Hellen Pollard: This is really the only decent introduction to the Tarascans. Pollard combines archaeological and historic sources in reinforcing ways. However, current research on the Tarascans is providing evidence which contradicts many of her conclusions. In particular, her population estimates are far too low on both individual and regional scales. Pollard also underestimates the size of pre-empire population in the Patzcuaro basin and often employs historical sources uncritically. Her work is still valuable as long as this is recognized.

### The Conquest of Michoacan: The Spanish Domination of the Tarascan Kingdom in Western Mexico, 1521-1530 (1985) by J. Benedict Warren: Warren's book offers an overview of events leading to the conquest of the Tarascan Kingdom leading up before the Spanish arrival to years after the Conquest of Mexico. The Tarascans followed a different path than the Aztecs by submitting to Spanish rule, but unfortunately the king at the time thought he could trick the Spanish by still collecting tribute. This lead to a lengthy trial and ultimate execution of the last Tarascan king. This is a heavy read with lots of dates and place names, but Warren does a fantastical job of painting a picture of events of an often overlooked area in Mexico.

### Shaft Tomb Culture/Teuchitlan Tradition
Anecdotal Sculpture of Ancient West Mexico (1972) by Hasso Von Winning and Olga Hammer. This volume of work is a go-to resource for those interested in the shaft tomb culture and Teuchitlan Tradition in West Mexico. Von Winning and Hammer document numerous ceramic models from museum collections and discuss the different types that commonly appear such as house models or the “bed figures”. While this volume does not discuss the more famous figures that are unfortunately the target of looters, it is none the less an important aspect of the culture and identity of the people who once occupied this often overlooked region of present day Mexico.

### The Shaft Tomb Figures of West Mexico (1974) by Hasso Von Winning. 
This volume of work is one of two books most commonly referenced for studies of shaft tomb figures associated with the shaft tomb tradition and Teuchitlan Tradition of West Mexico. Von Winning does an excellent job of trying to categorize and define figure types to provide a better understanding of these often looted pieces of history. The one drawback to the book is the fact that it was printed with black and white photographs which make it sometimes difficult to understand what exactly Von Winning is referring to when talking about painted elements of the figures. None the less this is an important work for anyone is interested in this region of Mexico.

### Ancient West Mexico - Art and Archaeology of the Unknown Past (1998) edited by Richard F. Townsend.
This volume of work is one of two books most commonly referenced for studies of shaft tomb figures associated with the shaft tomb tradition and Teuchitlan Tradition of West Mexico. Townsend and contributing authors provide a wonderful array of papers and essays discussing these mortuary items that have been heavily looted in the past. This volume, unlike Von Winning’s, provides the reader with wonderful and large color photographs of figures. Information about the figures have also been updated since Von Winning’s work, but any inquiry into the field will show that progress has been slow due to a lack of excavations, partly due to the rampant looting and partly due to researchers unable to find tombs to excavate. This is a recommended book for anyone who is interested in learning more about this region of Mexico.

### Andean
Andean Archaeology (2004) edited by Helaine Silverman. This is another edited volume by Blackwell Publishing, virtually identical to the Hendon and Joyce one above, except that it covers the Andean cultures of South America. It's a collection of academic papers written by scholars of different specialties. This is a good introductory work for advanced readers who already have some background in archaeology.

### The Incas by Terrence D'Altroy. This book provides a general introduction to Inca culture and history. 
It is written for a general audience, and is very accessible.

### The Cities of the Ancient Andes (1998) by Adriana von Hagen and Craig Morris. This book from Thames & Hudson is a great introductory overview of Andean prehistory. It hits on each of the major cultures and provides an gorgeous array of illustrations of artifacts, archaeological plans, architectural reconstructions, and intact site features.

### Conquest and New Spain
The Broken Spears: The Aztec Account of the Conquest of Mexico (1959 esp., 1962 eng. trans.) by Miguel Leon-Portilla. Uses recountings and poetry from native sources to create a counter-point to the story of the Conquest popularized by Bernal Diaz and other conquistadors. A good introduction to Leon-Portilla, who is a major figure in modern Aztec history and Nahuatl language studies.

### The Conquest All Over Again: Nahuas and Zapotecs Thinking, Writing, and Painting Spanish Colonialism by Susan Schroeder et al. 
Just as Leon-Portilla's Broken Spears offered to its audience a deeper insight into the perspectives of indigenous peoples during the Conquest of the Aztec Empire, so too does Schroeder's novel work The Conquest All Over Again refocus Mesoamerican history away from a Eurocentric perspective. Reviewing many of the major historical works produced by indigenous peoples during Stage II colonial history, Schroeder et al. shed light on the social forces that faced indigenous peoples after the fall of the Aztec Empire and how they perceived their world following the end of Mexica supremacy. For those seeking to understand the course of later Mexican history and its relationship to the region's pre-Columbian past, this text serves as a nearly unrivalled bridge between both eras.

### The True History of the Conquest of New Spain by Bernal Díaz del Castillo (~1568)
One of the most popular and comprehensive primary sources on the Conquest, the work offers a first hand account of the Conquistador's campaign through Mexico and defeat of the Aztecs. There has been some academic debate as to whether or not Bernal Diaz was actually there - as much of the work has clearly been lifted from Gomara's historia - but that debate is (in my humble opinion) still in its infancy. Diaz's account will probably be the most interesting work to lay people and does offer a vivid and moving description of the pre-Columbian Mexican world. Given it's intrinsic biases though, pairing it with a more critical modern interpretation of the Conquest (such as Restall's Seven Myths...) is strongly recommended.

Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and the Spaniard in Yucatan, 1517-1520 by Inga Clendinnen. Often the Spanish Conquest is understood as a quick and relatively one-sided affair that swept through the totality of Mesoamerica. Ambivalent Conquests sheds light on the experience of the Maya following the arrival of the Spanish in the Americas and their subsequent resistance (and alliance) with the conquistadors as they expanded the Spanish Empire. Clendinnen does a remarkable job of humanizing the Maya, who like other native groups are often rendered silent in Conquest histories. Readers will also find her treatment of the Spanish, particularly the infamous Diego de Landa, both enlightening and unique from other texts available on this subject matter. As a whole, Ambivalent Conquests epitomizes why Clendinnen and her scholarship are so respected in the field today.

### Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest by Matthew Restall
The image of the Conquest of Mexico as well as the Americas at larger has left a dramatic impression on not only world history but popular culture as well. Over the centuries a number of themes ranging from fantastically inaccurate to dangerously ahistorical have become attached to the Conquest, seven of which Restall expertly puts to rest. In the process of overturning these popular misconceptions, Restall teaches many lessons about the nature of historical inquiry and imperialism as a whole which many readers will find both thought-provoking an illuminating. Although his prose can be a bit cluttered at times, most readers will walk away from this this text with a completely different outlook on this remarkable chapter in our history and the societies - both European and American - that took part in it.

### Maya Conquistador by Matthew Restall.
Another of Restall's incredible works detailing the cultural persistence of the Maya. Notable for its remarkable usage of rare source material.

### Maya Society Under Colonial Rule
The Collective Enterprise of Survival by Nancy M. Farriss. A history of the colonial Maya as actors on their own stage, Farriss argues that their proven willingness for adaptability, even in pre-Columbian times, was critical to the Maya's survival.

### Rhetorical Conquests: Cortés, Gómara, and Renaissance Imperialism by Glen Carmn:
In work that is long overdue and quite impressive, Literarian Glen Carman magnificently and expertly deconstructs Hernan Cortes' letters to Charles V, exploring the diverse strategies employed by the (in)famous Conquistador and his secretary in their attempt to legitimize the destruction of the Aztec Empire. Carman's background in medieval Spanish language is apparent and greatly aids in this detailed unraveling of the textual subtleties of Cortes' writing. Ultimately readers will come to understand the extent of deceptive narration in Cortes and Gomara's works, a realization which is of paramount importance considering how foundational the impressions of these Spaniards are to past and present impressions of the Aztec Empire.

### The Nahuas After the Conquest: A Social and Cultural History of the Indians of Central Mexico, Sixteenth Through Eighteenth Centuries by James Lockhart. Huge study of the Nahua (Aztecs) after the conquest.

### The Conquest of the Last Maya Kingdom by Grant D. Jones (1998). Jones offers us a look at Colonial New Spain through the events of the conquest of the Itza Maya in 1697. Jones digs through the events that lead up to, during, and following the conquest with an abundant and impressive list of primary and secondary sources. Jones uses his book as a bridge to meld ethnographic accounts with archaeological evidence to not only shed light on the pre-Columbian Maya, but also to better understand the Itza at the time of conquest. It is a surprisingly insight and entertaining read that sometimes goes unnoticed by scholars, but treasured by the few who do read it.

### 19th Century to Present
Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America by John Charles Chasteen (2011). This work gives an overview of Latin American history and is remarkably readable. It is an excellent starting point for anyone new to the study of Latin American history.

### The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History edited by Jose C. Moya (2010). This is a lengthy book that examines the historiography of Latin America.

### The Latin America Readers Series published by Duke University Press. These are a series of country studies that provide a valuable overview of various Latin American countries. They use both primary and secondary sources by eyewitnesses and important scholars respectively to illuminate key periods of each country’s history. They also include a trove of images, maps, and fine art. Each volume focuses on a single country. Currently, Duke has published readers about the Dominican Republic, Chile, Paraguay, Guatemala, Ecuador, Perú, Costa Rica, Cuba, México, Argentina, and Brazil

### The Making of Modern Colombia: A Nation in Spite of Itself by David Bushnell (1993). A single-volume account of the history of Colombia best for those who want to learn the nuts and bolts of Colombian history. While certainly a multivolume approach would be preferable, the book should be a starting place for those who wish to become familiar with post-colonial Colombian history.

### Cuba: A New History by Richard Gott (2005). 
This is a good introduction to Cuban history. Gott attempts to fill the vacuum of literature on Cuban history by synthesizing recent academic sources. Over half of the work focuses on the twentieth century. It is not perfect; Gott leaves a lot of the nuance out of his narrative. Nevertheless, it provides a concise and valuable overview of Cuban history. After reading, consider seeking out other interpretations of recent Cuban history to complicate your understanding of Cuba.

### Americanos: Latin America’s Struggle for Independence by John Charles Chasteen (2009).
This book gives an account of the Latin American wars of independence, focusing especially on the unique personalities who helped make independence a reality. It is accessible and is an excellent place to start learning about the independence period. Because of its scope, the events in the book can get confusing at times. But then again, the revolutions were very confusing because so much was happening at once in different parts of Latin America. Keep in mind that this work surveys one particular historiographical view of independence by presenting the men and women at the top who led it politically and intellectually. Other interpretations of the period exist in specialist literature.

### Mexicans in Revolution, 1910-1946: An Introduction, by William H. Beezley and Colin M. Maclachlan.
Good primer/introductory text on the Mexican Revolution and its consequences.

### The Failure of Union: Central America, 1824-1960 by Thomas L. Karnes (1961). The fist half of his book addresses what is commonly called the United States of Central America, its founding and breakup. The second half of the book details the attempts at Union that occurred throughout the later 19th into the 20th centuries that also failed. There are extremely few books dealing with the Central American Republic, even fewer in English, this book helps fill that void.

### Politics, Economics, and Society in Argentina in the Revolutionary Period by Tulio Halperín-Donghi (1975). 
This is an important book on the independence period in the Río de la Plata. Although it is extremely dry, Halperín-Donghi provides one of the most thorough overviews of this extremely complex period in Argentine history. In the work, the author chronicles the rise and fall of social orders in the region. Some background knowledge on early Argentina will be needed to read this book. After reading, seek out scholarly literature written by José Chiaramonte, who has been reinterpreting the process of state formation in the wake of Halperín-Donghi.

### I Die with my Country: Perspectives on the Paraguayan War, 1864-1870 edited by Hendrik Kraay and Thomas Whigham (2005). In this series of essays on the Paraguayan War, many Latin American scholars present readable surveys of the causes, course, and effects of the War of the Triple Alliance, one of the bloodiest conflicts of the nineteenth century. The essays examine the war from Paraguayan, Brazilian, Uruguayan, and Argentine perspectives.

### Resistance and Integration: Peronism and the Argentine Working Class, 1946-1976 by Daniel James (1994). 
This book is a seminal work on Juan Perón and Peronism. It draws on previously unused oral sources to examine how Peronism took hold among the working class and overcame a multitude of challenges in the process. It was one of the first books to describe Perón as a product of history. You will want to be familiar with Argentine history and Perón before delving into this challenging work.

### Beneath the United States: A History of U.S. Policy toward Latin America by Lars Schoultz (1998). 
This book examines US foreign policy in Latin America. In it, Schoultz convincingly argues that underlying American involvement in Latin America over the last two centuries was a deep sense of superiority and implied racism. Despite the challenging topic, Schoultz writes with a readable and accessible style which is easily accessible by laypeople and specialists alike. Perhaps after reading, you will have a better understanding of why anti-American sentiment remains strongly ingrained in Latin American discourses.
