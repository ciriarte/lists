- [Cuando me pregunten ¿por qué?](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2015:1)

> "There are two kinds of pain. The sort of pain that makes you strong and useless pain, the sort of pain that's only suffering. I have no patience for useless things. Moments like this require someone who will act. To do the unpleasant thing. The necessary thing... [puts the dog out of its misery] There, no more pain."
